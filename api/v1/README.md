# DOCUMENTATION 

**I've seen APIs do with versions: v1, v2, v3 and more. And I thought and realized: this is the perfect option. If I want to rewrite my API, I create a new folder "/v2/".**
**This todo list of endpoint:**
- getProduct/{id}
- addProduct/
    ?name={value}
    &description={value}
    &article={value}
    &cost_price={value}
    &retail_price={value}
    &manufacturer={value}
    &surplus={value}
    &unit={value}
    &status={value}
and... I think and all time for write doc spent to train of thought... sorry. I'll do it when I have time.
